## Style Guidelines:

- The visual design should suggest 'earthy materialism', based on the rich farmland in Cameroon that could allow people to accrue real property. Primary color: A rich, muted brown (#8B4513), evoking stability and earthiness.
- Background color: Very light beige (#F5F5DC), nearly white to keep focus on the rich photography
- Accent color: A deep red-orange (#D2691E), like the soil, intended for CTAs.
- Clean, modern sans-serif font for headings and body text, optimizing for readability.
- Simple, clear icons for property types, locations, and amenities, aiding intuitive navigation.
- Grid-based layout for property listings to showcase properties in an organized manner.
